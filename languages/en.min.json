They provide detailed aircraft information via public 1090 MHz radio channel.","traffic-credits":"Matthias Schäfer, Martin Strohmeier, Vincent Lenders, Ivan Martinovic and Matthias Wilhelm<br />“Bringing Up OpenSky:A Large-scale ADS-B Sensor Network for Research”<br />In Proceedings of the 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), pages 83—94, April 2014","traffic-credits-headline":"Provided by $1","traffic-desc":"Real-time air traffic around the world","traffic-intro":"Besides worldwide airport information, this map shows up-to-date flight data of mostly more than 5,000 aircraft.","traffic-source-0":"ADS-B","traffic-source-1":"ASTERIX","traffic-source-2":"MLAT","traffic-source-3":"FLARM","traffic-time":"Contact @ <b>$1</b>","traffic-title":"Live Traffic","traffic-type-0":"Unknown","traffic-type-1":"No ADS-B Emitter Category","traffic-type-2":"Light (< 15’500 lbs)","traffic-type-3":"Small (< 75’000 lbs)","traffic-type-4":"Large (< 300’000 lbs)","traffic-type-5":"High Vortex Large","traffic-type-6":"Heavy (> 300’000 lbs)","traffic-type-7":"High Performance","traffic-type-8":"Rotorcraft","traffic-type-9":"Glider / Sailplane","traffic-type-10":"Lighter-than-air","traffic-type-11":"Parachutist / Skydiver","traffic-type-12":"Ultralight / Hang-glider / Paraglider","traffic-type-13":"Reserved","traffic-type-14":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","traffic-type-15":"Space / Trans-atmospheric vehicle","traffic-type-16":"Emergency Vehicle","traffic-type-17":"Service Vehicle","traffic-type-18":"Point Obstacle (incl. balloons)","traffic-type-19":"Cluster Obstacle","traffic-type-20":"Line Obstacle","unknown":"Unknown","valid-from-to":"Valid from <b>$2</b> to <b>$4</b> UTC","valid-until":"Valid until <b>$3 $4</b> UTC","vicinity-desc":"Search for airports, navaids and waypoints in the vicinity","vicinity-label":"Search @","vicinity-my":"Mypos","vicinity-my-title":"Use my current position","vicinity-navaids":"Navaids in the vicinity","vicinity-navaids-empty":"No navaids found in the vicinity.","vicinity-submit":"Coords","vicinity-submit-title":"Vicinity search at the given coordinates","vicinity-title":"Vicinity search","vicinity-title-at":"Vicinity search @ $1 $2","vicinity-waypoints":"Waypoints in the vicinity","vicinity-waypoints-empty":"No waypoints found in the vicinity.","view-airport":"View Airport","view-sigmets":"View active SIGMETs","vis-10":"more than 10&#8239;km","waypoints":"Waypoints","weather":"Weather","weather-airdens":"Air density","weather-altimeter":"Altimeter","weather-cat-desc":"List of Airport weather stations reporting $2 ($1) flight conditions","weather-cat-title":"$2 ($1)","weather-ceiling":"Ceiling","weather-desc":"List of worldwide airport weather stations, weather extremes and significant weather phenomena","weather-dewpoint":"Dew point","weather-extrema-cold":"Coldest place","weather-extrema-gust":"Wind gust","weather-extrema-horiz":"Worst visibility","weather-extrema-hot":"Hottest spot","weather-extrema-precip":"Heaviest precip","weather-extrema-vert":"Lowest ceilling","weather-extrema-wind":"Strongest wind","weather-relhum":"Rel. humidity","weather-title":"Weather Stations","weather-visibility":"Visibility","weather-windchill":"Wind chill","welcome-donate":"Donate now!","welcome-donate-thanks":"Thanks for your support","wiki-credits":"© Wikipedia | CC-by-SA-3.0 | <a href=\"https://$1.wikipedia.org/wiki/$2\"target=\"_blank\">Read more …</a>","wiki-headline":"About $1","wind-calm":"Wind&nbsp;<b>calm</b>","wind-calm-gust":"Wind&nbsp;<b>calm</b>","wind-cross":"Crosswind","wind-cross-left":"Crosswind from left","wind-cross-right":"Crosswind from right","wind-head":"Headwind","wind-kmh":"km/h","wind-kt":"kt","wind-tail":"Tailwind","wind-to":"Wind&nbsp;<b>$1&#8239;kt</b> to&nbsp;<b>$2</b>","wind-to-gust":"Wind&nbsp;<b>$1&#8239;kt</b> / gust&nbsp;<b>$3&#8239;kt</b> to&nbsp;<b>$2</b>","wind-up-to":"up to","wx-+":"heavy","wx--":"light","wx-bc":"patches of","wx-bl":"blowing","wx-br":"mist","wx-dr":"low drifting","wx-ds":"dust storm","wx-du":"widespread dust","wx-dz":"drizzle","wx-fc":"funnel cloud","wx-fg":"fog","wx-fu":"smoke","wx-fz":"freezing","wx-gr":"hail","wx-gs":"small hail","wx-hz":"haze","wx-ic":"ice crystals","wx-mi":"shallow","wx-pe":"ice pellets","wx-po":"sand whirls","wx-pr":"partial","wx-py":"spray","wx-ra":"rain","wx-re":"recent","wx-sa":"sand","wx-sg":"snow grains","wx-sh":"showers","wx-sn":"snow","wx-sq":"squalls","wx-ss":"sand storm","wx-ts":"thunderstorms","wx-up":"unknown","wx-va":"volcanic ash","wx-vc":"in the vicinity"}
