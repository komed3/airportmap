# Airportmap

Airportmap is an open source project with information and weather data on more than 74000 airports, heliports and air bases worldwide.

## Goal

The simple and straight forward goal of Airportmap (APM) is to bring people closer to the world of airports and create a fully searchable database. APM also aims to provide as accurate weather data as possible at thousands of locations around the world, and to enable fast searching and information using an interactive world map.

Airportmap is not the first and only project like this, but it scores with its modern look, speed, free provision and ease of use. The basic data will be presented in an appealing form and is searchable in many ways. Simplistic controls, a clear page structure and a platform based on fast web technologies should guarantee the stability of this project.

Information on this website is for private use only. Do not use for real life flight.

## Sources

The following sources were used to build this project, as well as to get the latest weather data and images on many airports.

Airport data, coordinates, runways, frequencies and similar data were taken from a variety of public accessible sources and online searchable databases. Automated processing of many data sets improved the quality of incoming raw data.

The images shown at a wide range of airports are taken from Wikipedias around the world and embedded via Wikimedia Commons. Corresponding copyrights are mentioned at the place where the image is displayed. Airportmap does not own any copyrights to the pictures.

The always up-to-date weather data for thousands of airports comes from the US government’s National Weather Service (NWS). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides an hourly updated METAR database via its text server, which is retrieved and processed by Airportmap five minutes after each full hour.

The SIGMET and I-SIGMET data originate from the same source and are retrieved via NOAA’s API at five-minute intervals.

Map data is available on the OpenStreetMap project, the tile server is provided by CARTO, and the library used is the well-known Leaflet.
