# Airportmap

[Airportmap](https://airportmap.de) is an open source project with information and weather data on more than [75’000 airports](https://airportmap.de/airports), heliports and air bases worldwide.

## Goal

The simple and straight forward goal of Airportmap (APM) is to bring people closer to the world of airports and create a fully searchable [database](https://airportmap.de/data). APM also aims to provide as accurate [weather data](https://airportmap.de/weather) as possible at thousands of locations around the world, and to enable fast searching and information using an interactive [world map](https://airportmap.de).

Airportmap is not the first and only project like this, but it scores with its modern look, speed, free provision and ease of use. The basic data will be presented in an appealing form and is searchable in many ways. Simplistic controls, a clear page structure and a platform based on fast web technologies should guarantee the stability of this project.

## Sources

The following sources were used to build this project, as well as to get the latest weather data and images on many airports.

Airport data, coordinates, runways, frequencies and similar data were taken from a variety of public accessible sources and online searchable databases. Automated processing of many data sets improved the quality of incoming raw data.

The images shown at a wide range of airports are taken from [Wikipedias](https://wikipedia.org) around the world and embedded via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org). Corresponding copyrights are mentioned at the place where the image is displayed. Airportmap does not own any copyrights to the pictures.

The always up-to-date weather data for thousands of airports comes from the US government’s [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov) (NWS). The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.aviationweather.gov) (NOAA) provides an hourly updated METAR database via its [text server](https://www.aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver_current/current/), which is retrieved and processed by Airportmap five minutes after each full hour.

The SIGMET and I-SIGMET data originate from the same source and are retrieved via [NOAA’s API](https://www.aviationweather.gov/help/webservice) at five-minute intervals.

Map data is available on the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org), the tile server is provided by [CARTO](http://basemaps.cartocdn.com), and the library used is the well-known [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com).

Live traffic data is fetched from [The OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org) at 15-minute intervals. This data is provided based on Matthias Schäfer, Martin Strohmeier, Vincent Lenders, Ivan Martinovic and Matthias Wilhelm: “Bringing Up OpenSky: A Large-scale ADS-B Sensor Network for Research”. In Proceedings of the 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), pages 83—94, April 2014.
